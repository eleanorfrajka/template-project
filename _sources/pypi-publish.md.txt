Publishing to PyPi
==================

Publishing your python package to PyPi will mean that other people can install it using e.g. 

```
pip install projectName
```

And then import the package into their python projects using

```
import projectName
```

A tutorial for how to do this can be found here:
[https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/)

Some notes *relative* to the tutorial are included here.

## Creating the package files

If you're using this template, you already have a `pyproject.toml`, `LICENSE` and `README.md` file in the root directory of your repository.  You also have the `tests/` directory and your package files are in `template_project/` rather than `src/`.

The file `pyproject.toml`  configures the metadata for your project.

### Choosing a build backend

The default example in the tutorial specifies "Hatchling" to convert your package to a distribution package. 

```
[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling >= 1.26"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"
```

In template-project, we instead have
```
[build-system]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"
requires = [
  "setuptools>=42",
  "setuptools-scm[toml]>=3.4",
  "wheel",
]
```

### Configuring metadata

As of April 2025, the example from the tutorial shows:
```
[project]
name = "example_package_YOUR_USERNAME_HERE"
version = "0.0.1"
authors = [
  { name="Example Author", email="author@example.com" },
]
description = "A small example package"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.8"
classifiers = [
    "Programming Language :: Python :: 3",
    "Operating System :: OS Independent",
]
license = "MIT"
license-files = ["LICEN[CS]E*"]

[project.urls]
Homepage = "https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject"
Issues = "https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject/issues"
```

where in this template, we have
```
[project]
name = "template-project-efw"
description = "Example template project for docs, pip install and git"
readme = "README.md"
license = { file = "LICENSE" }
maintainers = [
  { name = "Eleanor Frajka-Williams", email = "eleanorfrajka@gmail.com" },
]
requires-python = ">=3.8"
classifiers = [
  "Programming Language :: Python :: 3 :: Only",
  "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.8",
  "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.9",
  "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.10",
  "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.11",
  "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.12",
]
dynamic = [
  "dependencies",
  "version",
]
urls.documentation = "https://github.com/eleanorfrajka/template-project"
urls.homepage = "https://github.com/eleanorfrajka/template-project"
urls.repository = "https://github.com/eleanorfrajka/template-project"
```

In our case, the "name" (used for the name of the project on PyPi) is "template-project-efw" to make it a unique package, whereas the repository name is "template-project" on github.  

Our version also tries to dynamically assign the version number, which will come out of `template_project/_version.py`.

In `pyproject.toml` we have:
```
[tool.setuptools_scm]
write_to = "template_project/_version.py"
write_to_template = "__version__ = '{version}'"
tag_regex = "^(?P<prefix>v)?(?P<version>[^\\+]+)(?P<suffix>.*)?$"
local_scheme = "no-local-version"
```

*Action:** You should change the name, description, maintainers and urls to match your repository.

### Generating distribution archives

Run the next steps to generate the distribution.

First, make sure you have the latest version of `build` installed:
```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade build
```

Then run this from the directory where `pyproject.toml` is located:
```
python3 -m build
```

## Uploading the distribution archives 

### First time: Test it on testpypi first
1. Create an account on [https://test.pypi.org/account/register](https://test.pypi.org/account/register).  You'll need a 2FA app, e.g. on your phone.  If you already have an account, then you can login to your account at [https://test.pypi.org/](https://test.pypi.org), but this isn't necessary to run the test.

2. To upload your project, you'll need an API token.  Save this somewhere on your computer (not in your git repository).

3. Install twine (see tutorial instructions) or upgrade:
```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade twine
```

4. Run twine to upload the archives in `dist/`

```
python3 -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
```

If you get an error like
```
ERROR    InvalidDistribution: Invalid distribution metadata: unrecognized or malformed field 'license-file'
```
this is due to using the newest `twine` with oldish `packaging` and a build backend that produces invalid metadata.  Upgrade your packaging: `pip install -U packaging .`, and try again.

5. Verify that it works to install your package.  Create a virtual environment and install from testpypi as (CHANGING the package name to whatever yours is called)

```
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --no-deps template-project-efw
```

### Going live on pypi

Repeat the steps above but on [https://pypi.org](https://pypi.org).  You'll need a separate API token (save this on your computer!) and the final upload step will be

```
python3 -m twine upload dist/*
```

### Allowing Github releases to update the project on PyPi

To automatically generate the new release on PyPi using Github actions, you need (1) the workflow (see `.github/workflows/pypi.yml` in this template) and (2) to setup (on https://pypi.org) GitHub as a "trusted publisher".  

See [https://github.com/marketplace/actions/pypi-publish#trusted-publishing](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/pypi-publish#trusted-publishing) or [https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/creating-a-project-through-oidc/](https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/creating-a-project-through-oidc/) for more information.

# Workflow & Release tags on Github (generated by chatGPT)

This is my standard workflow for preparing and publishing a new version of a Python package to [PyPI](https://pypi.org), using GitHub Actions and OIDC authentication.

---

## ‚úÖ Workflow Steps

### üîÄ 1. Merge your PRs to `main`
Ensure all desired changes are merged into the `main` branch.

If you're working in a fork from the upstream, sync your main to upstream main on Github.com
---

### üñ• 2. On your local machine

```bash
# Switch to main and pull the latest changes
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Double-check you're at the tip of main
git log -1

# Tag the new release (PEP 440 format recommended)
git tag v0.0.2a5  # or whatever your next version is
git push upstream v0.0.2a5
```

‚úÖ Make sure you're tagging the **latest commit on `main`** ‚Äî if you tag an earlier one, `setuptools_scm` will think you're ahead of the tag and may bump to a version like `0.0.2a6.dev0`.

---

### üåê 3. On GitHub.com

0. Check that your new tag exists
1. Go to the **Releases** tab.
2. Click **‚ÄúDraft a new release.‚Äù**
3. Choose the tag you just pushed (e.g. `v0.0.2a5`) from the dropdown.
4. Fill in release notes (or link to your changelog).
5. Write your changelog/release notes (run `git log --pretty=format:"- %s (%h by %an)" v0.0.2a5..main`)
6. Click **‚ÄúPublish release.‚Äù**

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Result

- The GitHub Actions workflow is triggered by the published release.
- It checks out the tag, builds the package, and publishes to PyPI using OpenID Connect (OIDC).

---

### üí° Notes

- Always tag from the **tip of `main`** to avoid unintended version bumps.
- Tags must match [PEP 440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/) format (e.g., `v0.1.0`, `v0.2.0a1`).
- You can view the resulting release on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/fetchAZA/).
- Troubleshooting: If you get a `post1.dev0` or `.dev0` appended to your pypi version even though the GitHub tag looks ok, check whether your `_version.py` is in `.gitignore`.  It should be!
